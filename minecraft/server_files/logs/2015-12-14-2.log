[17:07:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> How're you?

[17:07:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> u?
[17:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I'm doing alright
[17:09:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> I have decided to never ride a horse on this server cuz it lagged so damn hard last time
[17:09:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> xD
[17:09:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I see
[17:09:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Hopefully we can get it on the google server so hopefully we won't have those problems.
[17:10:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> google server?
[17:12:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> U guys should make rabbit stew more often
[17:12:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> replenishes 5 corn dog things
[17:12:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> It's not effiecent and takes too much time
[17:13:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> rabbits don't always drop haunches and the soup takes an entire inventory space.
[17:13:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> y u dont make it all at once
[17:13:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Make what all at once?
[17:13:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> keep the ingrediants on hand
[17:13:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> not the product
[17:14:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> That still takes up 5 inventory stacks
[17:14:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> walking across thge path sucks
[17:14:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> What do you mean?
[17:14:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> hang on
[17:15:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> well that was close
[17:16:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> I couldnt run across the path thing to get back to the town, and nearly died
[17:16:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Why?
[17:16:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> no food
[17:16:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Ah
[17:16:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> oh and mobs
[17:16:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> but i has carrots now
[17:16:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> carrots protect me O>O
[17:18:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> u guys should look for wolves
[17:18:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I already have 10 of them
[17:18:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> waaw
[17:21:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> do u guys have an automated cocoa farm?
[17:21:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> yes
[17:21:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> noice
[17:21:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> with hoppers 2/
[17:22:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> No
[17:22:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Easy enough to do just haven't
[17:22:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> mmm
[17:24:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> but really the way the one I made is, is that it just goes straight into your inventory
[17:24:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> I know of a lazier version ;)
[17:25:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> which also can produce a full chest easily
[17:25:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> yeah but you don't normally use that much cocoa, so I figured it wasn't necessary
[17:25:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> true
[17:26:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> I remember a server that used cookies as currency, was pretty awesome and funny
[17:27:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Yeah if you had people that were exchanging services and items thats a cool idea.
[17:27:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> wanna make cookies a currency? xD
[17:27:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> jk if u have a farm to easy to do
[17:27:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> yeah not really worth it.
[17:28:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> more so if you are trying to theme a server and you make most blocks unbreakable.
[17:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> hmm. Well in the server it was a faction server, and it wasnt like 30 cookies for a diamond, more
[17:28:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> like 30 mill
[17:29:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> hmmm, that's kinda strange though as you can't carry 30mil
[17:29:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> they had a plugin that checked the amount of cookies in the chests chosen and then took it
[17:29:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> where do seeds go?
[17:29:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> oh
[17:30:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> non-edible crops
[17:30:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> but you are better off going to chicken farm and giving them to chickens.
[17:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> wheres le chicken farm? o.O
[17:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> we have so many
[17:30:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> other side of train station next to hores
[17:31:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> wheres it go

[18:15:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> sorry graphics driver failed.
[18:15:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> we have some leather but need it to make books as it's fairly hard to get
[18:15:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> it is?
[18:15:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> If you breed the cows you are welcome to kill one for each one you breed and try to get leather
[18:15:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> u have a cow farm yes?
[18:15:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> that way
[18:16:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> yeah
[18:16:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> it shouldnt be hard to make books then...
[18:16:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> hmmm
[18:16:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> It takes one leather for one book.
[18:16:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> ah
[18:16:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> quite costly
[18:16:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> used to take 3
[18:16:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> those days sucked
[18:16:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> true
[18:17:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> still sucks now though
[18:17:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> mmm Cuz i played in those days I dont think so xD
[18:17:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> especially since you don't always get leather from cows
[18:17:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> you don't think so what?
[18:17:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> that its as hard,
[18:18:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I didn't way it is as hard. I said it still sucks to make books.
[18:18:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> Oh ya
[18:18:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> I think cuz I have seen all the shitty recipes and days of mc I dont think it sucks as much, but as
[18:18:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> a newer player I could see that
[18:18:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I have as well.
[18:19:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I've played this before you have
[18:19:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> oh rly>
[18:19:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> I've played this since pre pre alpha
[18:19:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> damn
[18:19:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> u mega vetran
[18:19:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> when notch was still selling it for like 10 bucks
[18:19:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> well, I still think it doesnt suck :P
[18:19:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> That's fine. I still do. lol
[18:19:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> lol
[18:20:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> It took me all day irl to make a set of bookcases for an enchanting table.
[18:20:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> and it's still not finished.
[18:21:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> the cows are having great loud cow sex
[18:21:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> yeah that's what happens when you give em what they want

[18:22:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Not that I'm aware of.
[18:22:29] [Server thread/INFO]: Nameugone has just earned the achievement [Cow Tipper]
[18:23:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> why do the cows have so much space??
[18:23:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> So we can breed them a lot.
[18:23:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> And so they don't camp the gate to try and get out.
[18:24:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> brb
[18:24:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> If you don't give them enough space they try to get out and it's annoying
[18:24:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> k
[18:24:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Nameugone> it'd be cool if u guys had an armor stand
[18:25:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <KuroiRyuu8> Eventually, right now we are focused on making the infrastructure
